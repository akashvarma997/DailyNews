DailyNews is an application where you will find all the current news reated to different categories such as Science, Entertainment, Sports, Technology, Health and Business with each news publishing date, source and Author.

This app is build using function-based components.

I have used Bootstrap to improve the Styling and to increase the responsiveness.

react-routers are used to navigate between different categories without reloading the whole site which increases the performance and improved the user experience.

News API helped in fetching the current news.

Packages used :
  Routers,
  Infinite scroll,
  react-top-loading-bar
